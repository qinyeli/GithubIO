# Home

Hi! Welcome to my personal website :)

My name is **Qinye** `/*pronounced Chin-yeah*/`. I use this page mainly to showcase some random stuff that I created. For my professional experience as a software engineer, check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qinye-sindy-li-03a904113/) instead.

### About my name

I usually go by **Sindy** with English speakers because I know that my name is really hard to pronounce. I usually prefer to save the time of correcting Kuinne-yee (no..) to Chin-yeah (closer to what it sounds), but I do appreciate if you spent a little bit of time learning my original name. I was given both my names from my mother, and I love them both, so no pressure!
