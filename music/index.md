I love music!

I love singing and playing and making music. I love playing the guitar, the piano, the ukulele, and even the plastic recorder and the melodica we played back in our primary school days.

I am still reluctant to say "I play the piano" or "I play the guitar", just like a software engineer would think twice before putting "[proficient in C++](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-criteria-for-being-proficient-in-C++-in-the-software-engineering-industry)" on his/her resume. I mean, it's a rather big statement when I don't play Liszt or Paganini or [practice 40 hours a day](https://twosetviolin.fandom.com/wiki/Ling_Ling).

But I still love making sounds and charing my sanity that way.
